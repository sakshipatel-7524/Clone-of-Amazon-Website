# Clone-of-Amazon-Website


In my repository, I have developed a clone of the Amazon website using solely HTML and CSS. This project incorporates a range of both advanced and fundamental features of HTML and CSS. To view the website, please download the Visual Studio Code file, open index.html, and select "Show Preview" to fully experience the website. Additionally, ensure that all associated files, including the images used on the website, are downloaded and placed together in a single folder before opening in Visual Studio Code.
